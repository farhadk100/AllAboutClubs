# allaboutapps

This project is done only as a test project for AllAboutApps.at.

## Notes about the project

- The project has taken 3 hours to build.
- Most of the time has been spent on initial setup of the project and localization configuration.
- The localization method could be improved since I am using an old method from an old, small project I have had a year ago.
- The "Styles" class is a self-made class that I use in almost all my projects for purposes of easy, fast and seamless design with support of different resolutions.
- I do not have access to a mac device for configuring the apple side of the project (I use a friend's mac for purposes such as this, but he was not available in a short notice for this project. Needless to say that given that I start working for AllAboutApps, getting a Mac (or at least a mac VPS for smaller needs and quicker access) will be my priority.)
